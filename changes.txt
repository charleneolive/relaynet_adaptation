1. Segmentation labels
- split background into region above retina and region below RPE


2. Relu vs Prelu? = DONE
Original paper and method use Relu (I changed back to ReLU)

3. Transformations 
Validation dataset: Is this needed or just train is enough?  =? just train is enough as no validation
Are the transformations correct? => changed to be similar to matlab code

4. Some error with wmap = FIXED 
5. Not sure slicing width for training is by how much => also 64 

6. Train for how many epochs? => 60
7. Only need to split into train and test
