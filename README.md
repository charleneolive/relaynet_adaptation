## Description <a name="description"></a>

PyTorch Implementation of ReLayNet. The original implementation came from the original [github repo](https://github.com/ai-med/relaynet_pytorch) but some modifications are made by yours truly for the Data Resource for Healthy Controls and Multiple Sclerosis dataset. 

## About the Files <a name="about-files"></a>
1. `networks`: folder containing the model architecture, training, losses 
2. `preprocess`: folder to preprocess datasets.
3. `train.py`: train the model. Configuration file is `train.yaml` and identical jupyter notebook is `train.ipynb`
4. `test.py`: test on test datasets. Configuration file is `test.yaml` and identical jupyter notebook is `test.ipynb`

## How to Run the Codes <a name="run-codes"></a>
1. Modify `./preprocess/preprocess_config_JH.yaml` according to your needs. Run `preprocess_dataset.ipynb`.
2. Modify `./train.yaml` according to your needs. Run 
```bash
python train.py
```
3. Modify `./test.yaml` according to your needs. Run
```bash
python test.py
```
